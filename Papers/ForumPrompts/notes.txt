- Kizilcec paper:

    o Making grades depend on forum participation decreases intrinsic
      motivation. 

1. Forum participation in residential settings work similarly
    across offerings of the same course. Except that total use
    of forum is increasing over the years.
    
2. Even across different courses, participation/page rank unfold along
    a similar pattern (not sure at all this is true).  Course
    offerings have consistent change points over the years.
    
3. We do not observe differences in top-10% participation in courses
    where 2% credit is offered, vs. not.
    
4. Given 1, consistent critical points offer themselves during the
    quarter where students might get contacted about participation.

5. We confirm MOOC findings that page rank is focused on a few
    students.

6. The main differences between science/eng, and other courses are:
      ???

So, tomorrow, I'll try to find evidence for those points.

- I'll check the .csv for active-node numbers.
- I'll count how often change points occur in the same week(s) across
    the offerings of the same course (to get a percentage).
- I'll compare the above two across courses.
- Not sure right now how best to check 5, but I'll think of something.
- 6 will fall out of the above.

Does that sound about right?
