               the success of asynchronous online learning, with a
               specific focus on the social development of learning
               communities through online discussion. It reports on an
               empirical investigation of correlations between 22
               course design factors and student perceptions of
               satisfaction, learning, and interaction with
               instructors and classmates using data collected from 73
               courses offered through the State University of New
               York Learning Network (SLN) in the spring 1999
               semester. Data analyses revealed that three factors
               were significantly related to student
               perceptions—clarity and consistency in course design,
               contact with and feedback from course instructors, and
               active and valued discussion. An explanation for these
               findings may center on the importance of creating
               opportunities for interaction in online learning
               environments. In this vein, preliminary findings from
               research on the development of community in online
               course discussions is presented. Drawn from content
               analyses of asynchronous discussions in an online
               graduate course in education, this research examines
               the ways in which course participants use verbal
               immediacy indicators to support the development of
               online community. Findings support an equilibrium model
               of social presence in online discussion which suggests
               that as affective communications channels are reduced,
               discussion participants use more verbal immediacy
               behaviors to support interaction among
               classmates. Taken together, the findings support the
               importance of interaction for online teaching and
               learning.}

	abstract = {Choosing the “right” type of technology, either
               synchronous or asynchronous, to facilitate learning
               outcomes is a new challenge as the pace of emerging
               technologies increases and diversifies. Teachers are
               encouraged to design courses that require collaboration
               in online learning communities to facilitate the
               development of higher order thinking skills for life
               long learning. It is therefore important to gather
               evidence of the kinds of opportunities afforded to
               students and whether the students themselves endorse
               collaborative online tools as a legitimate method of
               assisting in their learning. This paper outlines the
               way in which one secondary school has used an online
               discussion forum to support students in the
               International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Program in
               enhancing research skills and skills for lifelong
               learning. The paper considers whether online
               collaborative tools are perceived by students as a
               positive way to improve learning outcomes.},

  comments={Online discussion forums have been shown to contribute to
            the trust and cohesion of groups, and their use has been
            associated with greater overall engagement in online
            courses. We devised two experimental interventions to
            encourage learners to participate in forums. A
            collectivist (“your participation benefits everyone”),
            individualist (“you benefit from participating”), or
            neutral (“there is a forum”) framing was employed to
            tailor encouragements for forum participation. An email
            encouragement was sent out to all enrolled users at the
            start of the course (study 1: general encouragement), and
            later in the course, to just those who had not
            participated in the forum (study 2: targeted
            encouragement). Encouragements were ineffective in
            motivating learners to participate. The collectivist
            framing discouraged contributions relative to the other
            framings and no encouragement. This prompts the question:
            To what extent do online learners experience a sense of
            community in current implementations of online courses?
