               the success of asynchronous online learning, with a
               specific focus on the social development of learning
               communities through online discussion. It reports on an
               empirical investigation of correlations between 22
               course design factors and student perceptions of
               satisfaction, learning, and interaction with
               instructors and classmates using data collected from 73
               courses offered through the State University of New
               York Learning Network (SLN) in the spring 1999
               semester. Data analyses revealed that three factors
               were significantly related to student
               perceptions—clarity and consistency in course design,
               contact with and feedback from course instructors, and
               active and valued discussion. An explanation for these
               findings may center on the importance of creating
               opportunities for interaction in online learning
               environments. In this vein, preliminary findings from
               research on the development of community in online
               course discussions is presented. Drawn from content
               analyses of asynchronous discussions in an online
               graduate course in education, this research examines
               the ways in which course participants use verbal
               immediacy indicators to support the development of
               online community. Findings support an equilibrium model
               of social presence in online discussion which suggests
               that as affective communications channels are reduced,
               discussion participants use more verbal immediacy
               behaviors to support interaction among
               classmates. Taken together, the findings support the
               importance of interaction for online teaching and
               learning.}

	abstract = {Choosing the “right” type of technology, either
               synchronous or asynchronous, to facilitate learning
               outcomes is a new challenge as the pace of emerging
               technologies increases and diversifies. Teachers are
               encouraged to design courses that require collaboration
               in online learning communities to facilitate the
               development of higher order thinking skills for life
               long learning. It is therefore important to gather
               evidence of the kinds of opportunities afforded to
               students and whether the students themselves endorse
               collaborative online tools as a legitimate method of
               assisting in their learning. This paper outlines the
               way in which one secondary school has used an online
               discussion forum to support students in the
               International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Program in
               enhancing research skills and skills for lifelong
               learning. The paper considers whether online
               collaborative tools are perceived by students as a

  comments={Online discussion forums have been shown to contribute to
            the trust and cohesion of groups, and their use has been
            associated with greater overall engagement in online
            courses. We devised two experimental interventions to
            encourage learners to participate in forums. A
            collectivist (“your participation benefits everyone”),
            individualist (“you benefit from participating”), or
            neutral (“there is a forum”) framing was employed to
            tailor encouragements for forum participation. An email
            encouragement was sent out to all enrolled users at the
            start of the course (study 1: general encouragement), and
            later in the course, to just those who had not
            participated in the forum (study 2: targeted
            encouragement). Encouragements were ineffective in
            motivating learners to participate. The collectivist
            framing discouraged contributions relative to the other
            framings and no encouragement. This prompts the question:
            To what extent do online learners experience a sense of
            community in current implementations of online courses?

            primary mode of interaction among instructors and
            students, have emerged as one of the important components
            of online courses. We empirically study contribution
            behavior in these online collaborative learning forums
            using data from 44 MOOCs hosted on Coursera, focusing
            primarily on the highest-volume
            contributors---"superposters"---in a forum. We explore who
            these superposters are and study their engagement patterns
            across the MOOC platform, with a focus on the following
            question---to what extent is superposting a positive
            phenomenon for the forum? Specifically, while superposters
            clearly contribute heavily to the forum in terms of
            quantity, how do these contributions rate in terms of
            quality, and does this prolific posting behavior
            negatively impact contribution from the large remainder of
            students in the class?

            We analyze these questions across
            the courses in our dataset, and find that superposters
            display above-average engagement across Coursera,
            enrolling in more courses and obtaining better grades than
            the average forum participant; additionally, students who
            are superposters in one course are significantly more
            likely to be superposters in other courses they take. In
            terms of utility, our analysis indicates that while being
            neither the fastest nor the most upvoted, superposters'
            responses are speedier and receive more upvotes than the
            average forum user's posts; a manual assessment of quality
            on a subset of this content supports this conclusion that
            a large fraction of superposter contributions indeed
            constitute useful content. Finally, we find that
            superposters' prolific contribution behavior does not
            `drown out the silent majority'---high superposter
            activity correlates positively and significantly with
            higher overall activity and forum health, as measured by
            total contribution volume, higher average perceived
            utility in terms of received votes, and a smaller fraction
            of orphaned threads.  }

abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to examine how effective higher
            education institutions have been in harnessing the data capture
            mechanisms from their student information systems, learning management
            systems and communication tools for improving the student learning
            experience and informing practitioners of the achievement of specific
            learning outcomes. The paper seeks to argue that the future of
            analytics in higher education lies in the development of more
            comprehensive and integrated systems to value add to the student
            learning experience.Design/methodology/approach – Literature regarding
            the trend for greater accountability in higher education is reviewed
            in terms of its implications for greater “user driven” direction. In
            addition, IT usage within higher education and contemporary usage of
            data captured from various higher education systems is examined and
            compared to common commercial applications to suggest how higher
            education management and teachers can gain greater understanding of
            the student cohort and personalise and enhance the learning experience
            much as commercial entities have done for their client base. A way
            forward for higher education is proposed.Findings – If the multiple
            means that students engage with university systems are considered, it
            is possible to track individual activity throughout the entire student
            life cycle – from initial admission, through course progression and
            finally graduation and employment transitions. The combined data
            captured by various systems builds a detailed picture of the
            activities students, instructors, service areas and the institution as
            a whole undertake and can be used to improve relevance, efficiency and
            effectiveness in a higher education institution.Originality/value –
            The paper outlines how academic analytics can be used to better inform
            institutions about their students learning support needs. The paper
            provides examples of IT automation that may allow for student
            user‐information to be translated into a personalised and
            semi‐automated support system for students. },
