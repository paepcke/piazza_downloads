\section{Introduction}

Many massively open online course (MOOCs) rely heavily on online forum
facilities. The remote course participants are expected to communicate
by posting questions and opinions on the learning management system's
forum. Instructors and teaching assistants sometimes selectively
respond via that medium. Importantly, the courses rely on the students
themselves to answer each others' questions in comments to
posts. Whereas in science courses the forum often serves primarily the
exchange of questions and answers, humanities courses frequently
require discussions among students. The forum plays an even more
central part in these scenarios.

Given their importance in MOOCs, a number of studies have examined
student behaviors on MOOC forum facilities. For example, forum
participation has been studied as an early indicator of student
dropout \cite{yang2013}. The distribution of forum post submissions
among course participants was examined in \cite{Huang2014}. This
examination showed that frequent posters, or {\em superposters} do
better in courses than the average among other participants. The
authors further find that the presence of superposters has positive
impact on the rest of the forum participants.

But forum facilities have also steadily gained acceptance in
residential, classroom bound courses. The forum there is a supplement
to in-class discussion---if such face-to-face interactions even occur
in the lecture hall. Studies on how academic outcomes are related to
forum participation in residential settings are missing because access
to grades in these settings tends to be highly restricted. This work
suffers from this limitation as well.

However, we can at least hypothesize that benefits such as those found
by \cite{Huang2014} do carry over to residential students. If we
accept for the moment that forum participation is indeed beneficial,
then we need to ask how, and when instructors can encourage students
to participate with posts and comments on others' contributions.

In a MOOC setting, \cite{kizilcec2014encouraging} showed that
variously framed emails encouraging the use of the forum yielded mixed
results. But residential students operate under very different
incentive structures. Most desire a successful completion of each
course. Even large residential classes are much smaller than MOOCs,
and students often know at least some of their peers from face-to-face
meeting.

We analyzed a number of Piazza forum posting behaviors in a large
residential college. Our goal with this preliminary work was to find
promising points during a quarter for {\bf when} to send encouraging
emails to students who are overly passive on the forum. We also
propose a data-informed method for {\bf personalizing} such messages.

\section{Dataset}

Since 2011 many courses in the university have used the Piazza forum
facility for its internal courses. Our dataset comprises the posts and
comments of these usage years. From among 5000 university course
offerings that have used the Piazza forum facility since 2011 we
selected nine courses, with a total of around 40 offerings. Most
courses were taught multiple times since 2011, so we include
longitudinal forum usage data for most courses.

We used two criteria for selecting the courses to analyze. We favored
those that had comparatively large numbers of student posts, and we
tried to cover courses from many schools and departments. We in
particular sought to include Humanities courses that made use of
 Piazza for class discussion. Table~\ref{tab:simpleCrsStats} summarizes
 our choice.

From the forum posts of these data we constructed one social graph for
each course offering. We then analyzed changes in two social graph
measures over time to find `important' weeks.

\section{From Posts to Connection Graph}

Social networks are most simply modeled by considering each
participant as a node, and interactions initiated by participants as
out-directed links. In our case each node represents a student,
i.e. we only define one type of node. Links in our forum interaction
graph represent one student posting, or commenting on another
student's contribution. That is, our links are
unidirectional. Multiple interaction initiations by one student are
captured by weighting the corresponding outgoing links. Many graph
analysis tools operate on models of this type.

Other strategies for viewing forum traffic as a graph exist to cover
different goals. For example, \cite{Anwar2013} additionally consider
posts themselves as one type of node. Linkages between the post nodes
represent topics connections. Similarly, when user communication
facilities operate on particular platforms, such as underground
forums, which include private `buddy' connections, then such
facilities may need to be modeled as well \cite{Moto2011}.

For the purpose of identifying candidate time points for encouraging
online conversation participation our chosen model suffices. Note that
we are not in this work considering additional measures, such as
content quality, for which a richer model would be required.

Many measures are used to quantify various aspects of social graphs
\cite{hann2005, lesk14}. Not all are meaningful in the context of
education-related forum interactions. We focus here on two measures:
{\em out-degree}, and {\em page rank}. Figure~\ref{fig:forumGraph}
illustrates.

\begin{figure}[htp]
       \centering
       \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Figs/forumNetworkExample.pdf}
       \caption{\textnormal{Example social graph induced by forum posts.}}
       \label{fig:forumGraph}
\end{figure}

Nodes $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$ represent students. The link from
$A$ to $B$ is marked with the number $3$, because $A$ commented three
times on one of more of $B$'s posts. The number of outgoing links is
the node's {\em out-degree}. For example, the {\em out-degree} of $A$
is $4$.

The number of incoming links is called the node's {\em
  in-degree}. Node $C$'s in-degree is $1$. Node $E$ has no links
entering or exiting. The respective student has not participated in
the forum.

Analogous to Web pages, each node can be assigned a {\em page
  rank}. The intuition in this context is that student $S_1$'s
presence in the forum is more `important' than student $S_2$'s if the
node representing $S_1$ has higher page rank than the node that
represents $S_2$. In our context the intuition behind page rank is
that a node $N$ is more important (has higher page rank) the more
other important nodes comment on $N$'s posts. Imagine a scenario
in which student $S_1$ posts an interesting question, to which many
students comment with their opinion, creating a long thread. The node
representing $S_1$ would experience an increase of its page rank with
every incoming comment. Node $B$ in Figure~\ref{graphExpl} is an
example for this situation. Its in-degree is $4$. If $B$ were to
comment on one of $D$'s posts, then $D$'s page rank would increase
more than if the low-page-rank node $C$ commented on $D$.

In terms of evaluating a student's participation in the forum, a high
page rank, and high out-degree are positive. Low values are less
positive. We chose these two values because of their relatively
straight-forward meanings when applied to forum posts, and for their
relevance to our goal of identifying potential intervention times.

Some of the fifteen other measures we computed, such as {\em
  betweenness} are meaningful for forum scenarios as well, but their
usefulness depends on one's analysis goals. For example,
\cite{yang2013} include several of those measures for the purpose of
persistence prediction. For evaluating contribution {\em quality} the
contents of posts would need to be considered: students who
persistently post irrelevant contents contribute less positively to
the forum than constructively participating students. However, for our
purposes the two measures of page rank and out-degree provide strong
enough signals.

\section{Analysis Procedure}

For each course we identified the top 10\% of forum-contributing
students as measured by their postings across the entire course. For
those students we computed the average of our chosen social graph
measures. This average was computed for each week of each
offering. The results provided a week-by-week time series of postings
and evolving pagerank for these students.

Figure~\ref{fig:cs229OutDeg} shows a typical time series with the sum
of postings (i.e. weighted out degree) on the ordinal, and weeks into
the quarter on the abscissa.

           contributors throughout an academic quarter (machine
           learning class).}}
       \label{fig:cs229OutDeg}
\end{figure}
Notice in Figure~\ref{fig:cs229OutDeg} that the successive increases
in average contribution of the top 10\% appear to take a jump after
week 5. Such a discontinuity, or {\em change point} could be a good
trigger for encouragements of students who have held back
participation. However, visual inspection is insufficient for
determining whether this change is statistically significant, or could
easily be explained by random noise instead. The question mark in the
figure is a reminder of this uncertainty.

We therefore next constructed a bootstrapped CUSUM analysis over the
total number of forum posts of a course offering, measured every week
\cite{tayl16}.  For each series of course offerings this analysis
yielded the degree of consistency of significant forum post activity
changes throughout the offerings.

Our bootstrap permuted the post readings, and re-computed the CUSUM
points 1000 times. For each permutation we computed the $S_{diff}^0 =
S_{max}^0-S_{min}^0$ and determined whether $S_{diff}^0$ was less than
the corresponding value $S_{diff}$ in the CUSUMs of the correctly
ordered number of posts. We accepted that a change point occurred
sometime in a quarter at a confidence level of 95\%. That is, we
accepted that a change point occurred if at least 950 of the
permutations yielded an $S_{diff}^0$ less than $S_{diff}$.

Following \cite{tayl16} we determined the last week before a change
for each change point. Figure~\ref{fig:cs229ChangePts} shows an
example.
\begin{figure}[htp]
       \centering
       \includegraphics{Figs/cs229Fall14ChangeAnalysis.png}

           time series of a machine learning course.}}
       \label{fig:cs229ChangePts}
\end{figure}
The top chart's line shows changes in the average posts contributions
by the top-10\% contributors during the previous week. The bottom
chart's line shows for each week the accumulated differences from the
mean of the weekly contribution changes. For example, up to about week
five, weekly postings by the top-10\% was below the average of 5. The
corresponding downward segment of the CUSUM reflects increasingly
negative sums of those differences. During week 5 weekly contributions
begin to rise above the mean, and the CUSUM `recovers' upward towards
zero.

The horizontal (red) lines in the top chart indicate the upper and
lower limits within which week-to-week differences in posts
contributions would be expected to vary just by
chance\footnote{Assuming normal distribution of contribution
  difference values}. The lines are called {\em control limits}, and
we will discuss their potential real-time use during a course's run
time in the discussion section (Section~\ref{sec:discussion}).

The highlighted points in Figure~\ref{fig:cs229ChangePts} (top)

\begin{itemize}
\item Consider student post content quality
\item Consider consistency: contribute throughout course
\item Consider influence on others
\item Draw instructor attention to dense topic clusters, which might
  indicate confusion, or student excitement to harness.
\end{itemize}
%% Control charts are of significance for our scenario, because
%% breakages across control bounds can be observed at any point in
%% time. Instructors could therefore be alerted weekly of any students
%% (or average of larger student groups) who are atypical in their
%% posting behavior. Bootstrap procedures, which permute data points many
%% times, computing target measures like means each time require that all
%% data points are available for the procedure. On the other hand, these
%% procedures can detect multiple change points that occur in the
%% examined data.
